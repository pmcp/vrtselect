This project was used as a smoke screen for testing a new concept for VRT. It has been set up really quickly, I used Applify, a theme I bought at themeforest.net (https://themeforest.net/item/applify-app-landing-page-html/20000720).

The whole thing was set up in a couple of hours. The main target was to test if there was interest in the product, so I tagged the call to actions using Google Tag Manager and measured the engagement funnel.

The website is too heavy for what it is, especially some gifs. But the results of the tests were very good, so it made it's point.
